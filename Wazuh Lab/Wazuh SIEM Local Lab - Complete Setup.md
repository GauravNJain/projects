# 🚀 Wazuh SIEM Local Lab - Complete Setup

A hands-on **Wazuh SIEM lab** built locally to learn real-world threat detection, endpoint monitoring, and log analysis.  
This project includes a complete setup of the Wazuh Manager, Dashboard, and multiple endpoint agents, giving me a full mini-SOC environment to practice cybersecurity operations.

> 🔥 **Goal:** Build my own SIEM environment, understand endpoint telemetry, and explore how Wazuh strengthens visibility, detection, and response.

### **9️⃣ Now the Windows agent will also be added on the Wazuh server dashboard**
- The agent will now be shown in the 'Endpoints' section on wazuh server dashboard

![windows agent added to wazuh](https://github.com/GauravNJain/Wazuh-Lab-Setup/blob/main/lab%20screenshots/(Server)%20Ubuntu%2064-bit%20wazuh%20dashboard%20linux%20and%20windows%20agent%20added.png)

### **🔟 Now even the windows endpoint can easily be monitor on the server using Wazuh**
- We can use wazuh to monitor our windows agents from basic vulnerability detection to advanced threat hunting, almost everything!
